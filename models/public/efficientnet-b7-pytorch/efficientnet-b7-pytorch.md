# efficientnet-b7-pytorch

## Use Case and High-Level Description

The `efficientnet-b7-pytorch` model is one of the [EfficientNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946) group of models designed to perform image classification. This model was pretrained in TensorFlow\*, then weights were converted to PyTorch\*. All the EfficientNet models have been pretrained on the ImageNet image database. For details about this family of models, check out the [repository](https://github.com/rwightman/gen-efficientnet-pytorch).

The model input is a blob that consists of a single image 3x600x600 in RGB
order. The RGB mean values need to be subtracted as follows: [123.675,116.28,103.53]
before passing the image blob into the network. In addition, values must be divided
by [58.395,57.12,57.375].

The model output for `efficientnet-b7-pytorch` is the typical object classifier output for
the 1000 different classifications matching those in the ImageNet database.
